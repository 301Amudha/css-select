This is a draft for a CSS selector library that works from the top (as the engines inside browsers). Functions are used pretty intensely, it will be interesting to see how well this performs.

Current state: Working prototype. The code should be restructured, the number of function calls should be lowered and the API needs to be improved. And documentation needs to be written.
